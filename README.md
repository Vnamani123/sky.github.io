# Welocme to the Sky in 3D!

This project is an assignment which inculdes turning a 2D-painting into a 3D scene. I used many models and 3D objects for this projects as my paiting is called in-the-heat-of-night-over-baghdad by Leo Amoling. The paiting represents a dry and burning sky with the helicopters seen as the savior and a supply holder. I hope that my interpretation is well-presented. 🎨

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: The source code and combines both the html and css of this scene

← `assets`: The many imports and frameworks that I used such as the Ocean-Plane scenary and Three.JS

## Try this next 🏗️

Next time, I would add more dark clouds to make the sun look brighter and more fog near the water

## First time with Aframe and why?!

Excited to learn more 3D modeling and using Aframe in the future!
